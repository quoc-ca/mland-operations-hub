## Notes

- The physical identity-service configuration, development/test environment, data-retention period, privacy wording, and final phone/contact data policy are deliberately retained as `TBD` dependencies. They are not implementation choices embedded in this specification.
- This spec resolves UC-02 business behaviour only. It does not ratify the placeholder constitution or authorize implementation.
